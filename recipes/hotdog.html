    <p>These French onion hotdogs are generously topped with caramelized onions, Gruyere cheese, and a quick homemade Dijonnaise sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        <li>4 yellow onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Country Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>6 Hawaiian or brioche hot dog buns</li>
        <li>6 cooked beef hotdogs</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups freshly shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Making</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange a rack to the upper third position of oven. Preheat oven to broil.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering, about 30 seconds. Add onions, toss until well coated in oil, and cook undisturbed until browned on one side and slightly softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir onions and continue to cook undisturbed until browned on other side, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add salt and broth and cook, making sure to scrape up any brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pan, until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 2 minutes. Stir in Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, thyme, and black pepper, and cook until fragrant and onions are brown all over, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk together mayo and Dijon mustard until smooth; transfer Dijonnaise sauce to a squeeze bottle if desired.</li>
        <li>Place hotdog buns on a large rimmed baking sheet. Add a hotdog to each bun, drizzle with prepared Dijonnaise sauce, and top with about 1/3 cup caramelized onions. Sprinkle each hotdog with a generous amount of cheese.</li>
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and brown, about 2 minutes. Garnish with thyme leaves.</li>
    </ol>
